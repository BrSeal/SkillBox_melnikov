The Orks are a biologically-engineered species, created more than 60 million Terran years ago as a warrior
race originally called the Krork by the long-vanished reptilian alien species known as the Old Ones, whom
the Orks refer to as the Brain Boyz. The ancient Krork were known to possess more advanced technology than
 that of the present Greenskin race, and to be on average larger, in some cases standing as tall as 12 metres.

The Orks were created by the Brain Boyz to fight the Necrons and their C'tan masters in the great interstellar
 conflict called the War in Heaven that shattered the galactic civilisation of the Old Ones that existed prior
  to the rise of the Eldar.

Orks are thus genetically engineered to be muscular, aggressive, and none too bright;
their technology is maintained by a caste of Oddboyz who possess genetically-implanted
dispositions and technical knowledge that grant them unusual skill with maintaining and
developing technology.
However, this skill is an unconscious one preserved through genetic
memories hard-wired into the Oddboyz's DNA by the Brain Boyz millions of standard years ago.
Indeed, the Brain Boyz were apparently able to encode information on how to build simple
machinery into the genomes of all Orks; thus Mekboyz require very little training in their
function within Ork "kultur," since they understand mechanical principles at a fully
instinctive level.

Orks lack individual psychic power, being denied such abilities by the Old Ones.
However, they do have a sort of collaborative, collective psychic ability, meaning
that if enough Orks believe something is true, then it will actually become so,
brought into power by their gestalt psychic ability. For example, Ork rockets
painted yellow create bigger explosions, simply because the vast majority of Orks
believe they do. This is also why much of the Orks' seemingly ramshackle technology
will do terrible damage in the hands of Orks, but will cease to function when used
by other races.
